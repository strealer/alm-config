# Puppet Agent Configuration
# This file is managed by the puppet-config.sh script
#
# IMPORTANT: This file exists in TWO repositories:
# 1. alm-infra/puppet-infra-config/client-setup/puppet.conf (private repo)
# 2. alm-config/system-files/puppet.conf (THIS FILE - PUBLIC repo - used by pi-gen)
#
# When updating this file, ALWAYS update BOTH locations!
# The alm-infra version is used for manual setups and reference.

# Runs the agent service every 5 minutes
# Optimized for:
# - Allowing Docker image pulls to complete without overlapping runs
# - Reducing Puppet server load (600 devices = 120 req/min vs 300 req/min)
# - Better thermal management on Raspberry Pi devices
# - Still fast enough for updates (worst case: 5-7 min deployment time)
